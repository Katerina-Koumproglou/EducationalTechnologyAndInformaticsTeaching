# EducationalTechnologyAndInformaticsTeaching
The purpose of this website is to evaluate an educational institution's performance based on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The user can input scores for 34 different indicators (I1–I34), each representing a key aspect of sustainability. The system processes this data, applies weighted calculations, and determines a final score reflecting the institution’s alignment with SDG principles. Furthermore, the website provides feedback on areas needing improvement and visualizes performance trends over time. Finally, this website is in Greek and to run it simply open the file "index.html" to a browser of your choice or access it through this link https://katerina-koumproglou.github.io/EducationalTechnologyAndInformaticsTeaching/ !
